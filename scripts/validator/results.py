# ── Composite-axis dethronement floor (2026-04-22) ──────────────────────
# A challenger that passes the KL paired t-test (p<0.05) AND the 3% epsilon
# margin is still blocked from taking the crown if its worst composite axis
# is below this floor. Motivation: the 2026-04-22 king (tom9491/distil-32)
# passes KL handsomely but rambles 3–10x longer than the teacher on trivial
# "hi"/"2+2=" prompts. Under raw KL that pathology is invisible — on-policy
# RKL, length ratio, and the think-probe degeneracy axes all see it
# directly. Without this veto a KL-specialized model can win even as its
# generations become unusable.
#
# Floor choice: 0.20 is the "catastrophic failure" threshold for any axis
# we care about. Concrete interpretation per axis:
#
#   * length   (penalty < 0.20 ⇒ student > 5x teacher tokens; clear ramble)
#   * on_policy_rkl (score < 0.20 ⇒ on-policy RKL > 5x king; diverged)
#   * capability (score < 0.20 ⇒ < 20% of teacher pass rate on verifiables)
#   * degeneracy (score < 0.20 ⇒ half-plus of think prompts degenerate)
#   * kl       (not applicable to dethroners: by construction their kl
#              axis is ~1.0 since they beat the king on KL)
#
# If the composite isn't populated on enough axes (e.g. chat_probe and
# think_probe both errored) the gate fails open — we don't want an
# eval-side outage to freeze the crown.

    Goodhart guard (2026-04-28): the held-out evalscope canary showed
    kings regressing -7.4pp on gsm8k and -10.2pp on BBH versus the
    Qwen3.5-4B base (state/benchmarks/baseline_qwen35_4b.json gsm8k
    0.934 vs king 0.86; bbh 0.879 vs king 0.777). The composite gate
    can't catch this because the validator's procedural items don't
    reach that absolute level — a challenger gaming math_bench at 0.92
    can still be -0.10 below where the *base* model would score on the
    same items, which is direct evidence the model has *regressed* on
    real capability rather than gained it.

    This gate is paired-evaluation: when the reference (Qwen3.5-4B
    base, REFERENCE_UID = -1) is included in the same round
    (INCLUDE_REFERENCE_IN_ROUND=1), challenger and reference see the
    *same* block-seeded items, so the comparison is sample-paired and
    free of cross-round prompt drift. If the reference isn't in the
    round (legacy behavior), this veto silently fails open.

    Threshold: a challenger that scores below the reference by more
    than ``BASELINE_FLOOR_MARGIN`` on any of the gsm8k-/humaneval-/bbh-
    transfer axes (math_bench, code_bench, reasoning_bench,
    ifeval_bench, aime_bench, mbpp_bench) is blocked from dethrone.
    Default 0.10 = 10pp absolute margin: a small regression is allowed
    to avoid sample-noise false positives, but a -10pp absolute drop
    on a held-out-transfer axis vs the SAME 4B base reads as the
    model is genuinely worse than the un-distilled control.

    Returns None when:

        least non-regressive)
    Returns ``{"reason": str, "axis": str, "challenger": float,
