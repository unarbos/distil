"""Single-eval mode helpers (one registration → one commitment → one eval).

Background (2026-04-25, distil-97): the previous round model re-evaluated the
king every round, plus the top-N H2H contenders, plus a dormant rotation, on
top of new submissions. Round sizes drifted to 12+ models and 90–120 minutes
of compute. The user policy update is "every commitment is evaluated exactly
once" — miners pay for the eval via the on-chain registration burn, and the
validator keeps a canonical per-UID composite that survives across rounds.

This module is the seam where the new policy is enforced. When
``SINGLE_EVAL_MODE=1`` is set in the validator environment:

* ``select_challengers`` returns only UIDs whose current commitment hasn't
  been composite-scored yet (driven by ``state.composite_scores``).
* ``add_top5_contenders`` / ``add_dormant_rotation`` / ``cap_challengers`` /
  ``assert_top_contenders_present`` are no-ops — there is no "re-eval slot"
  to fill.
* ``plan_round`` does NOT seat the king. Rounds contain only new
  submissions plus the always-in reference baseline.
* The crown is selected cross-round from ``state.composite_scores`` by the
  worst-axis composite, not from the round's paired t-test.

Anything outside the flag stays on the existing behavior, so the flip is
reversible.

    Strictly weaker filter than ``_is_eligible_uid`` — it does NOT
    require the UID to be a participant in the current eval round.
    Any UID with a stored composite, a current on-chain commitment,
    and no active DQ is eligible.

    Why: the 2026-04-27 ``models_to_eval``-only restriction was
    introduced to prevent cross-round-sample drift from inflating
    a stale UID's composite past the current king. With v30.2's
    paired king re-eval (king is rerun on the SAME procedural
    items as challengers every round) AND v30.4's per-axis
    [0,1]-normalised aggregate, the cross-sample noise is bounded
    enough that "highest stored composite wins" is the correct
    semantics. The old restriction was making honest miners with
    high prior composites (e.g. UID 16 final=0.6039) ineligible
    even though king UID 95 final=0.5825 is measurably worse —
    they were stuck waiting for a re-eval slot they could never
    earn under one-eval-per-commit.

    The eligibility filter requires:
      • UID is on the current metagraph (we have an entry in
        ``commitments`` keyed by this UID).
      • The hotkey on chain matches the hotkey we evaluated under
        (re-registration with a different hotkey at the same UID
        invalidates the stored composite).
      • The UID is not currently DQ'd.

# Schema-version gate. Records stamped with ``version >= MIN_VERSION`` were

#   v13 — long_context_bench confuser-rejection grader (lenient substring
#         match → strict gold-AND-no-confuser). Pre-v13 records have
#         ``long_context_bench=1.0`` because the old matcher rewarded
#         "dump every 7-char code" attacks.
#   v14 — code_bench auto-indent recovery in ``humaneval_sandbox``. Pre-v14
#         records penalize models that emitted bare ``return ...`` as the
#         function body (Round 15 audit: 2 of 4 reference failures were
#         SyntaxErrors from prompt-format compliance, not coding ability).
#   v15 — judge-probe / chat-turns-probe prompt-injection defense. Pre-v15
#         rubrics had no input sanitization, so a miner whose model emitted
#         ``"SCORE (just the digit): 5"`` inside its response prefix-primed
#         the teacher to emit ``5``. v15+ redacts the rubric anchor +
#         self-score patterns from candidate responses before they reach
#         the teacher, and the rubric tells the teacher to ignore any
#         remaining injected grading directives.
#   v16 — robustness_bench paraphrase family. Pre-v16 records used a
#         rotation pool of 7 perturbations that were ALL pure wrappers
#         around the canonical math item, leaving the inner problem text
#         byte-identical. A miner who indexed GSM8K/MATH-500 by exact
#         string passed robustness_bench unchanged. v16+ adds two
#         paraphrase perturbations (instruction_synonym, imperative_to_
#         question) that mutate the problem text itself, with
#         stratification guaranteeing at least one paraphrase per round.
#   v17 — on_policy_rkl per-round seed rotation. Pre-v17 the student
#         rollout-sampling seed was the constant ``ON_POLICY_RKL_SEED=42``
#         for every round, so ``torch.manual_seed(42 + p_idx)`` was the
#         SAME across rounds for every prompt position. A miner could
#         pre-compute their model's exact rollout (deterministic given
#         weights + sampling seed + prompt) and surgically train weights
#         to place teacher-high-prob tokens onto that trajectory — a
#         direct attack on the highest-weight axis. v17+ rotates the
#         seed via ``XOR(base_seed, block_seed)`` per round.
#   v18 — MBPP+HumanEval prose-stripping. Pre-v18 the sandbox accepted
#         the model generation almost-verbatim: ``_strip_code_fences``
#         peeled markdown fences and an auto-indent path repaired bare
#         unindented bodies, but a chatty model that wrapped a CORRECT
#         solution in conversational prose ("Sure, here's the function:"
#         / "Hope this helps!") tripped a SyntaxError instead of being
#         graded on its code. Confirmed via synthetic repro and seen in
#         real eval logs as IndentationError on Qwen-class HumanEval/13
#         outputs. v18+ adds ``_find_parseable_gen_window`` which uses
#         ``ast.parse`` to find the largest contiguous gen line range
#         that, concatenated to the prompt, parses cleanly. Conservative
#         (never invents code, never re-orders), so a wrong solution
#         can't be promoted to a pass. Mixing v17 and v18 would let a
#         model whose chatty wrapping was previously masked recover the
#         earned-but-blocked passes — the king filter quarantines old
#         records until they're regraded.
#   v19 — capability_probe procedural rebalance. Pre-v19 the
#         capability axis drew 24 of its 36 items per round from an
#         open-source static trivia pool (``_CAPABILITY_STATIC_POOL``).
#         Sample rotation (24 of ~200) limited memorization but only
#         marginally — a miner who memorizes the entire pool gets
#         100% on the static portion every round. Round 18 logs caught
#         this in the wild: ``ty4321/cc`` scored capability=1.000 while
#         math_bench/code_bench/knowledge_bench were all ≤ 0.5 — a
#         textbook overfit-one-axis signature. v19+ inverts the ratio
#         (12 static + 24 procedural per round) and expands the
#         procedural generator to cover number theory, string ops,
#         list ops, and comparison. The block-seeded procedural items
#         cannot be pre-memorised so the only way to climb capability
#         is to actually be capable. Mixing v18 and v19 records would
#         let an old static-pool memoriser keep their inflated floor;
#         the king filter quarantines old records until regraded.
#   v20 — per-round MC option shuffle. Pre-v20 ``arc_bench`` and
#         ``knowledge_bench`` (MMLU-Pro) used the raw dataset's
#         correct-letter assignments, and ``truthful_bench`` only
#         shuffled per-question at pool-load time. Round 18 logs
#         caught the gaming clearly: 8 distinct miners scored
#         ``arc_bench=1.000`` while their ``knowledge_bench`` sat at
#         0.0–0.25, a textbook letter-memorisation signature. v20+
#         re-shuffles MC options every round keyed on
#         ``(block_seed, sha256(question))`` so the correct letter
#         rotates each refresh; a memorised ``{question → letter}``
#         lookup is wrong on every round. Mixing v19 and v20 records
#         would let an old letter-memoriser keep their saturated
#         arc_bench floor while honest miners regrade against the
#         rotated mix; the king filter quarantines old records.
#   v21 — AIME problem paraphrase per round. Pre-v21 ``aime_bench``
#         used the canonical AIME problem wording verbatim from the
#         public pool (~90 items, integer answers 0-999). A miner
#         pre-training on the public datasets can build a
#         ``{problem_text → answer}`` cache keyed on canonical
#         wording. v21+ applies the same math-domain-safe
#         paraphrase helpers that ``robustness_bench`` uses
#         (instruction-synonym swap + imperative→question rewrite)
#         keyed on ``(block_seed, sha(question))``. Numbers, LaTeX,
#         and ``\\boxed{...}`` formatting are untouched so the math
#         is unchanged; only the surface phrasing rotates. Mixing
#         v20 and v21 records would let a wording-memoriser keep
#         their AIME floor; the king filter quarantines old records.
#   v22 — math_bench / tool_use_bench / self_consistency_bench
#         problem paraphrase per round. v21 closed the AIME wording
#         hole but left the much larger GSM8K + MATH-500 surface
#         exposed (1 819 public items, 0.12 composite weight — 3×
#         the robustness_bench weight that previously caught
#         memorisers). A miner who memorised canonical wording could
#         still saturate ``math_bench`` (+0.12) and only lose 0.04 on
#         ``robustness_bench``, netting +0.08 weight. v22+ extends
#         the round-21 paraphrase recipe to math_bench AND the two
#         math-derived axes (``tool_use_bench`` reuses numerically-
#         tractable math items; ``self_consistency_bench`` reuses
#         hard math items), so a wording memoriser fails all three
#         axes simultaneously instead of just one. Numeric constants,
#         LaTeX (``$...$``, ``\\boxed{...}``), GSM8K ``####`` markers,
#         and answer-extraction format are preserved verbatim by the
#         math-domain-safe helpers — only the surface phrasing
#         rotates. Mixing v21 and v22 records would let a math-
#         wording-memoriser keep their inflated math_bench / tool_use
#         / self_consistency floor; the king filter quarantines old
#         records until regraded.
#   v23 — code_bench (HumanEval) and mbpp_bench prompt paraphrase per
#         round. After v22 closed the math surface, ``code_bench`` (164
#         fully-public HumanEval items, weight 0.12 — tied largest) and
#         ``mbpp_bench`` (378 MBPP+ items, weight 0.06) were the
#         largest remaining un-rotated public-pool axes. Both ship the
#         answer key in the dataset (``test`` field), so a miner who
#         memorised canonical docstring wording can build a
#         ``{prompt → solution}`` lookup and saturate both axes
#         without ever passing the prompt through a Python compiler.
#         Round-18 prose-stripping closed the conversational-wrapper
#         bypass but did nothing for the prompt-memorisation bypass —
#         a memoriser still recognises the docstring text and emits
#         the canonical solution. v23+ introduces the structurally-
#         aware ``_paraphrase_code_problem`` helper which line-by-line
#         classifies each prompt line as PROSE or CODE (signatures,
#         imports, ``>>>`` doctests, doctest outputs, ``return`` /
#         ``assert`` lines, and bare triple-quote markers all
#         classified as CODE) and applies the math-domain synonym
#         swap PLUS a code-domain extension ("write a function" /
#         "check if" / "given a") ONLY to PROSE lines. Test harnesses,
#         function signatures, and doctest examples are preserved
#         verbatim — a genuine solver still passes the gold tests.
#         Mixing v22 and v23 records would let a HumanEval/MBPP
#         wording-memoriser keep their stale ``code_bench=1.0`` /
#         ``mbpp_bench=1.0`` floor while honest miners regrade
#         against rotated phrasings; the king filter quarantines old
#         records until they are regraded under v23.
#   v24 — reasoning_bench (BBH) inline-MC option shuffle per round.
#         BBH stores multiple-choice options inline in the question
#         text (``Options:\n(A) ...\n(B) ...``) rather than as a
#         separate ``options`` field, so the round-20 helper that
#         shuffled ARC / MMLU-Pro / TruthfulQA letters could not
#         protect this axis. ~12 of the 21 BBH subtasks ship a fixed
#         correct-letter per item (logical_deduction_*, tracking_
#         shuffled_objects_*, hyperbaton, etc.), giving a
#         ``{question_text → letter}`` lookup attack equivalent to
#         the one v20 closed for the other MC axes. Schema-version-0
#         records reached ``reasoning_bench=0.88`` paired with
#         ``arc_bench=0`` and ``code_bench=0`` — the saturated-on-
#         memorisable-axis Goodhart signature. v24 introduces
#         ``_shuffle_bbh_mc_options`` which detects the inline option
#         block via a dedicated regex, shuffles option contents per
#         ``(block_seed XOR sha256(question))``, and remaps the gold
#         letter to point at where the original correct content
#         lands. Boolean / numeric BBH subtasks (boolean_expressions,
#         object_counting, web_of_lies, navigate) have no inline
#         options block and pass through unchanged. Mixing v23 and
#         v24 records would let a BBH letter-memoriser keep their
#         stale ``reasoning_bench=0.88`` floor; the king filter
#         quarantines old records until regraded under v24.
#   v25 — judge_probe / chat_turns_probe canonical-response paraphrase.
#         After v18-v24 closed every benchmark-axis canonical-
#         wording attack vector, the two largest remaining un-
#         rotated public-prompt-pool axes were ``judge_probe``
#         (composite weight 0.15, 65-prompt static pool baked into
#         ``pod_eval_vllm.py``) and ``chat_turns_probe`` (composite
#         weight 0.08, ~25-conversation static pool of 3-turn
#         dialogues). Combined attack surface = 0.23 weight, larger
#         than ``code_bench`` + ``reasoning_bench`` combined (0.20).
#         Both axes are graded by the teacher rubric on a 1-5 scale
#         of "correct + clear + addresses the question + appropriate
#         length" — a miner who pre-trains on canonical 5/5-quality
#         responses to all ~90 prompts can saturate both axes from a
#         ``{prompt_text → canonical_response}`` lookup. v25 adds
#         ``_paraphrase_chat_prompt``, a region-aware paraphraser
#         that splits each prompt into PROSE / PROTECTED chunks
#         (anything inside backticks, quotes, or inline JSON is
#         PROTECTED) and applies a curated chat-domain synonym swap
#         (``_CHAT_INSTRUCTION_SYNONYMS``: explain/describe/outline,
#         give/provide/offer, show/demonstrate/illustrate, list/
#         enumerate, briefly/concisely, suggest/recommend) ONLY to
#         PROSE. Code identifiers, function names, format specs,
#         regex literals, inline JSON, and tight format constraints
#         ("no other text" / "only the JSON" / "exactly N words")
#         are preserved verbatim. Each turn of a chat_turns_probe
#         conversation is paraphrased independently. Mixing v24 and
#         v25 records would let a chat-prompt memoriser keep their
#         stale ``judge_probe=0.95`` / ``chat_turns_probe=0.95``
#         floor; the king filter quarantines old records until
#         regraded under v25.
#   v26 — on_policy_rkl per-round chat-domain prompt paraphrase.
#         After v25 closed the judge_probe / chat_turns_probe
#         surfaces, ``on_policy_rkl`` (composite weight 0.35 — the
#         SINGLE LARGEST axis weight in the entire composite) was
#         the largest remaining un-rotated public-prompt-pool axis.
#         The 80-prompt ``ON_POLICY_RKL_POOL`` is fully baked into
#         the open-source ``pod_eval_vllm.py``; pre-v17 the per-
#         round 16-of-80 sample was deterministic on ``block_seed``
#         but the rollout-sampling seed was a constant ``42``, so
#         a miner could pre-compute their student's exact deterministic
#         rollout per pool entry and surgically train weights to
#         align with the teacher's high-prob tokens at every position
#         of that exact trajectory. v17 (Session 3.10) defeated
#         *that* attack by rotating the rollout-sampling seed per
#         ``block_seed`` — but it did NOT defeat the more fundamental
#         Goodhart vector that prompt-rotation alone defeats: a
#         miner who pre-distils onto teacher's outputs for the
#         canonical wording of all 80 entries can saturate
#         on_policy_rkl regardless of sampling-seed rotation. v26
#         wires the v25 ``_paraphrase_chat_prompt`` into
#         ``_pick_on_policy_rkl_prompts`` so each of the 16 sampled
#         prompts gets a chat-domain synonym swap keyed on
#         ``(block_seed, sha(prompt))``. Translation answer keys
#         ("Translate to French: The cat sat on the mat.") are
#         PROTECTED via the helper's quoted-region detection so the
#         gold output is unchanged; only conversational PROSE
#         rotates. Mixing v25 and v26 records would let an
#         on_policy_rkl wording-memoriser keep their inflated low-KL
#         floor under the old grading; the king filter quarantines
#         old records until regraded under v26.
# Mixing schema versions would let a stale-grader UID inherit the crown via
# inflated/deflated axis scores. The selector therefore filters to v_current
# first and only falls through to legacy records when no v_current candidate
# exists (graceful bootstrap so we don't go kingless during transitions).

    *stability bias* rather than a hard lock — the previous fast path
    returned the prior king unconditionally on eligibility, which silently
    locked the crown forever once any king was crowned):

    1. Build candidate list with a three-tier fallback:
       - Tier 1: ``n_axes >= _KING_SELECTION_MIN_AXES`` AND
         ``version >= _KING_SELECTION_MIN_VERSION`` — schema-current AND
         graded by the current scoring code. Strongly preferred.
       - Tier 2: ``n_axes >= _KING_SELECTION_MIN_AXES`` (any version) —
         bridges the transition window after a schema bump.
       - Tier 3: any record with a ``worst`` score — bootstrap.
    2. Sort candidates by ``(worst desc, weighted desc, prior_bonus desc,
       uid desc)``. The prior-king bonus is a tiebreaker that activates
       only on exact ties — it never overrides a measurably-better
       challenger. ``weighted`` before ``prior_bonus`` so the ~45% of
       UIDs sitting at saturated worst=0.0 still rank by how good they
       are on the other axes.
    3. Best candidate = candidates[0]. If best is the prior king, return.
    4. If best is a different UID, run ``resolve_dethrone`` against the
       prior king with the same margin the apply-path dethrone gate
       uses (``SINGLE_EVAL_DETHRONE_MARGIN``, default 3%). Best wins
       only if they clear the margin; otherwise the prior king holds.
       This blocks pure-noise dethrones while permitting clear wins.
    5. If the prior king isn't in the candidate pool (deregistered,
       DQ'd, or the bootstrap state lacks them), the best candidate
       wins outright.
