"""Multi-axis composite score computation — production ranking + dethrone gate.

Core idea: a single scalar like KL can be over-optimized until the model is
useless under autoregressive sampling (the Tiapkin 2025 "Teacher Hacking"
pathology, empirically visible on the 2026-04-22 SN97 king, which rambles
3–10x longer than the teacher on trivial prompts while passing KL). The
fix is to score each student on several independent axes and combine them
with a worst-case rule, so that gaming any single axis penalizes overall
rank.

This module is intentionally pure-Python, no ML deps, safe to import from
the validator service. It consumes the JSON that ``pod_eval_vllm.py``
writes per student and emits a ``composite`` score and per-axis breakdown.

Status: PRODUCTION — ranking + dethrone veto.
  * 2026-04-19 (commit 8eec9a2): promoted from shadow to production
    ranking key. ``composite.worst`` orders the leaderboard and selects
    the canonical challenger for display.
  * 2026-04-22: ``composite.worst`` is now ALSO a dethrone gate. A
    challenger that passes the KL paired t-test + 3% epsilon is still
    blocked from taking the crown if its worst composite axis is below
    ``COMPOSITE_DETHRONE_FLOOR`` (currently 0.20). See
    ``scripts/validator/results.py::_composite_dethrone_veto``.
  * Same commit: the ``length`` axis is now always populated even when
    ``THINK_COLLAPSE_PROBE=0``. It falls back to the always-on
    ``chat_probe`` length vs a teacher anchor captured in
    ``prepare_teacher_probe_refs_*``. This closes the gap that let a
    KL-specialized-but-rambling model keep the crown unopposed.
  * 2026-04-23: judge-probe axis added in SHADOW mode. The teacher
    scores each student's greedy response to 16 rotated realistic
    prompts on a 1-5 rubric, normalized to [0, 1]. Computed + logged
    per round but excluded from ``worst`` / ``weighted`` aggregation
    until the ``JUDGE_AXIS_IN_COMPOSITE`` gate flips (Session 2). See
    ``reports/2026-04-23-goodhart-immune-eval.md``.
  * 2026-04-24: **Arena v3 — comprehensive eval**. Session 2 promoted:
    the five absolute-correctness bench axes (``math_bench``,
    ``code_bench``, ``reasoning_bench``, ``knowledge_bench``,
    ``ifeval_bench``) and ``judge_probe`` are now all IN the composite
    ranking by default. These break the last Goodhart hole — the old
    six axes all scored *relative* to the teacher, so a perfectly-
    distilled model of a non-SOTA teacher ranked #1 but couldn't do
    grade-school math. New axes score against ground truth so
    overfitting them ⇒ SOTA small model.
  * 2026-04-24: **Session 3 axes promoted live**:
    ``aime_bench`` (AIME olympiad math), ``mbpp_bench`` (MBPP+ code),
    ``tool_use_bench`` (agentic Python tool use), and
    ``self_consistency_bench`` (majority-vote over sampled generations).
    These give miners more surface area to optimize against, each
    pointing towards a genuinely valuable capability. See
    ``reports/2026-04-24-arena-v3.md`` for the full Affine-Cortex-
    inspired design.
  * 2026-04-24: **Pareto majority dominance**: in addition
    to the worst-axis floor, a challenger that beats the king on KL
    but loses on a majority of axes is blocked. This is part of the
    dethrone gate by default after the public telemetry window.
  * 2026-04-25: Session 3.1 ``arc_bench`` (AI2 ARC-Challenge
    commonsense science MC), 3.2 ``reasoning_density`` (pass_frac ×
    length_bonus — explicitly penalizes over-think-on-trivia),
    3.3 ``chat_turns_probe`` (teacher-graded 3-turn dialogues),
    3.4 ``truthful_bench`` (TruthfulQA adversarial factuality),
    3.5 ``long_context_bench`` (procedural needle-in-haystack
    over ~1400 tokens — literally uncheatable because items are
    generated fresh every round from the block_seed, no fixed
    dataset exists), and 3.6 ``procedural_bench`` (block-seeded
    synthetic reasoning / instruction following / factual retrieval).
    Each targets a capability that Session 2 + relative axes don't
    already reward, so climbing them requires genuine model improvement. See
    ``reports/2026-04-24-arena-v3.md`` and the ``MINER_FAQ.md``
    playbook.

Axes that are missing for a given round (e.g. ``degeneracy`` while
``THINK_COLLAPSE_PROBE=0``) drop out and the weighted mean renormalizes
over the surviving axes. The veto fails open if fewer than
``COMPOSITE_DETHRONE_MIN_AXES`` axes are populated — we don't want a pod
probe outage to freeze the crown.

    #     scored 0.50 by random-pick, ceiling for the king is around
    #     0.75 — small dynamic range, and the signal it carries is
    #     dominated by knowledge_bench + reasoning_bench. Conceptually
    #     duplicative.

    #     surface (~50 question categories). Top miner saturated with
    #     refusal-trained heuristics, not real epistemic discipline.
    #   * ``procedural_bench`` (was 0.05): now covered by the post-v27

Cut weight 0.20 redirected to harder axes the user explicitly asked us to make more binding (aime_bench +0.04, mbpp_bench +0.02, tool_use_bench +0.02, long_context_bench +0.01, robustness_bench +0.03) and to the relative-axis cluster (math_bench +0.02, code_bench +0.02, reasoning_bench +0.02, ifeval_bench +0.02). Per-round item budgets shrunk on the muted axes (knowledge: 10→0, arc: 8→0, truthful: 6→0, procedural: 6→0, self_consistency: 6→0, noise_resistance: 4→0) and bumped on the high-value ones (math: 10→12, aime: 6→8, code: 6→8, mbpp: 6→8).

Mixing v27 and v28 records is unsafe because v27 records carry six axes the v28 ranker now ignores — the king filter (``_KING_SELECTION_MIN_VERSION = 28``) quarantines old records until regraded under v28 so the dethrone gate never compares v27-axes-passed-on-luck to v28-honest-ranking. Session 3.20 — full procedural switch for math_bench / code_bench / reasoning_bench / knowledge_bench / ifeval_bench / aime_bench / mbpp_bench / tool_use_bench / self_consistency_bench / arc_bench / truthful_bench / robustness_bench / noise_resistance_bench. Pre-v27 every benchmark axis sampled from public datasets (GSM8K + MATH-500 + HumanEval + MBPP + BBH + MMLU-Pro + IFEval + AIME + ARC + TruthfulQA). v18-v26 paraphrase / option-shuffle / prompt-rotation hardening rotated the surface form of public items but the (problem, gold) pair on disk was unchanged, so a miner with a {paraphrased_question → answer} lookup over the public corpus could still saturate the axis. v27 generates the bench items per round directly from ``block_seed`` via 6 new procedural generators in ``pod_eval_vllm.py`` (_generate_math_items / _generate_aime_items / _generate_code_items / _generate_reasoning_items / _generate_mc_items / _generate_ifeval_items). The (parameters, gold) pair is fresh every round and exists nowhere on disk — there is no dataset to memorise. The public datasets remain available for ``scripts/eval_pod/auto_benchmark.sh`` post-hoc evalscope verification against the king on a separate Lium pod, but the validator never trains-or-evals against the public items. Round duration unchanged because per-item generation is microseconds. Mixing v26 and v27 records would let a v26 memoriser keep their inflated public-pool floor under the old grading while honest miners regrade against fresh procedural items every round — the king filter (``_KING_SELECTION_MIN_VERSION = 27``) quarantines old records until regraded under v27. Session 3.19 — on_policy_rkl per-round chat-domain prompt paraphrase. After v25 closed the judge_probe / chat_turns_probe surfaces, ``on_policy_rkl`` (composite weight 0.35 — the SINGLE-LARGEST axis weight in the entire composite, larger than the next two combined) was the largest remaining un-rotated public-prompt-pool axis. The 80-prompt ``ON_POLICY_RKL_POOL`` is fully baked into the open-source ``pod_eval_vllm.py``; pre-v17 the per-round 16-of-80 sample was deterministic on ``block_seed`` but the rollout-sampling seed was a constant ``42``, so a miner could pre-compute their student's exact deterministic rollout per pool entry and surgically train weights to align with the teacher's high-prob tokens at every position of that exact trajectory. v17 (Session 3.10) defeated *that specific* attack by rotating the rollout-sampling seed per ``block_seed`` (XOR with ``ON_POLICY_RKL_SEED``) — but it did NOT defeat the more fundamental Goodhart vector that prompt rotation alone defeats: a miner who pre-distils their student onto ``teacher_logprobs(prompt)`` for the canonical wording of all 80 pool entries can saturate ``on_policy_rkl`` regardless of sampling-seed rotation, because the student has been trained to place teacher-likely tokens at every position the teacher would. Rotating the *surface form* of the prompt every round forces a student that wants to keep its low-KL floor to actually generalise across phrasings — which is the entire point of distillation. v26 wires the v25 ``_paraphrase_chat_prompt`` helper into ``_pick_on_policy_rkl_prompts`` so each of the 16 sampled prompts gets a chat-domain synonym swap (``_CHAT_INSTRUCTION_SYNONYMS``: explain/describe/outline, give/provide/offer, list/enumerate, briefly/concisely, etc.) keyed on ``(block_seed, sha(prompt))``. The helper is region-aware so translation answer keys ("Translate to French: The cat sat on the mat.") are PROTECTED — only conversational PROSE rotates, the quoted source text and the language tag survive byte-identical so the gold output of a translation prompt is unchanged. JSON-output specs ("Output a JSON object with keys 'name' and 'age'..."), function-signature requests, and bash one-liner prompts likewise survive because their format constraints sit inside protected single-quoted regions. The math-domain default synonym table is *not* layered in (the helper uses ``_apply_chat_synonyms``) so verbs like ``find``/``calculate``/``determine`` in the on_policy_rkl reasoning sub-pool ("Is 97 prime? Answer with reasoning.") read naturally because they are NOT rewritten — only chat-domain prose rotates. Mixing v25 and v26 records would let an on_policy_rkl wording-memoriser keep their inflated low-KL floor under the old grading while honest miners regrade against rotated phrasings — the king filter quarantines old records until regraded under v26. Session 3.18 — judge_probe / chat_turns_probe canonical-response paraphrase. After v18-v24 closed every benchmark-axis canonical-wording attack vector, the two largest remaining un-rotated public-prompt-pool axes were ``judge_probe`` (composite weight 0.15, drawn from a 65-prompt static pool baked into ``pod_eval_vllm.py``) and ``chat_turns_probe`` (composite weight 0.08, drawn from a ~25-conversation static pool of 3-turn dialogues). Combined attack surface = 0.23 weight, larger than ``code_bench`` + ``reasoning_bench`` combined (0.20). Both axes are graded by the teacher rubric on a 1-5 scale of "correct + clear + addresses the question + appropriate length" — a miner who pre-trains on canonical 5/5-quality responses to all ~90 prompts can saturate both axes from a ``{prompt_text → canonical_response}`` lookup without doing any genuine chat work, the same canonical-wording memorisation Goodhart vector closed for math / code / BBH in v18-v24, just on a smaller surface. v25 introduces ``_paraphrase_chat_prompt`` which is region-aware: it splits each prompt into alternating PROSE / PROTECTED chunks (anything inside triple-backtick fences, single-backtick code, single or double quoted strings, or inline ``{...}`` JSON-like blocks is PROTECTED) and applies a chat-domain synonym swap (``_CHAT_INSTRUCTION_SYNONYMS``: explain/describe/outline, give/provide/offer, show/demonstrate/illustrate, list/enumerate, briefly/concisely, suggest/recommend, etc.) ONLY to PROSE chunks. Code identifiers (``range(5)`` / ``list(...)``), function names (``is_palindrome``), format specifiers (``'PROS: <a, b>; CONS: <c, d>'``), regex literals (``\\d{5}``), inline JSON (``{"name": "Ada", "langs": ["py", "go"]}``), and tight format constraints ("no other text" / "only the JSON" / "exactly N words") are all preserved verbatim — so the rubric-graded format adherence is unchanged and the answer key implicit in code-output prompts (``print(list(range(3, 10, 2)))``) still matches. The math-domain default synonym table is *not* layered in for chat (the helper uses ``_apply_chat_synonyms`` which bypasses the math defaults) because English homonyms (``"find a movie"`` / ``"calculate the cost"``) make indiscriminate ``find/calculate/determine`` rewrites read awkward in conversational prose. Per-prompt seed is mixed via ``_stable_seed_from_text`` so cross-validator agreement is preserved while the swap rotates per ``block_seed``. Each turn of a chat_turns_probe conversation is paraphrased independently so a memoriser keyed on "Give me a simple recipe for chocolate chip cookies." → "Provide a simple recipe..." on round N → "Offer a simple recipe..." on round N+1 sees a different surface every round across all three turns. Mixing v24 and v25 records would let a chat-prompt memoriser keep their inflated ``judge_probe=0.95`` / ``chat_turns_probe=0.95`` floor while honest miners regrade against rotated phrasings — the king filter quarantines old records until regraded under v25. Session 3.17 — reasoning_bench (BBH) inline-MC option shuffle per round. After v23 closed the code surface, ``reasoning_bench`` (0.08 weight, 21 BBH subtasks) was the largest remaining un-rotated MC public-pool axis. ~12 of the 21 BBH subtasks (logical_deduction_*, tracking_shuffled_objects_*, disambiguation_qa, geometric_shapes, hyperbaton, movie_recommendation, penguins_in_a_table, ruin_names, snarks, temporal_sequences) ship with a fixed correct-letter per item, encoded INLINE in the question text as ``Options:\\n(A) ...\\n(B) ...``. The round-20 ``_shuffle_mc_options_for_round`` helper couldn't be reused because BBH stores options inline rather than as a separate ``options`` field. Schema-version-0 records (pre any Goodhart hardening) reached ``reasoning_bench=0.88`` paired with ``capability=0.99`` / ``arc_bench=0`` / ``code_bench=0`` — the textbook saturated-on-memorisable-axis Goodhart signature. v24 introduces ``_shuffle_bbh_mc_options`` which parses the inline ``Options:\\n(A) ...`` block via a dedicated regex, shuffles option contents per ``(block_seed XOR sha256(question))`` to match v20's keying convention, and remaps the gold letter to point at where the original correct content lands. Boolean / numeric subtasks (boolean_expressions, object_counting, web_of_lies, navigate) have no inline options block and pass through unchanged so the helper degrades gracefully on the entire BBH pool. The rebuilt question keeps the canonical ``Options:\\n(A) ...\\n(B) ...`` shape so the model sees a familiar BBH format and the existing answer-extraction regex (``\\(?[A-Z]\\)?``) keeps working. Mixing v23 and v24 records would let a BBH letter-memoriser keep their inflated ``reasoning_bench=0.88`` floor while honest miners regrade against rotated letters; the king filter quarantines old records until regraded. Session 3.16 — code_bench (HumanEval) and mbpp_bench prompt paraphrase per round. After v18-v22 closed the math / multiple-choice / tool-use / self-consistency surfaces, ``code_bench`` (164 fully-public HumanEval items) and ``mbpp_bench`` (378 MBPP+ items) became the largest remaining un-rotated axis pair on the validator. ``code_bench`` carries weight 0.12 (tied with ``math_bench`` for the largest single axis weight) and the entire pool plus answer key is open-source, so a miner can build a ``{prompt → solution}`` lookup keyed on canonical docstring wording and saturate the axis without ever passing the prompt through a Python compiler. Round-18 prose-stripping closed the conversational-wrapper bypass; round 23 closes the prompt-memorisation bypass that prose-stripping could not. v23 introduces ``_paraphrase_code_problem`` which is structurally aware: it tokenises the prompt line-by-line, classifies each line as PROSE or CODE (function signatures, ``import``/``from``/``class``/``@``/``return``/``assert`` lines, ``>>>`` doctest inputs, doctest outputs, and bare triple-quote markers all classified as CODE), and applies the math-domain synonym swap PLUS a code-domain extension (``_CODE_INSTRUCTION_SYNONYMS``: "write a function" / "check if" / "given a" rotations) ONLY to PROSE lines. Function signatures, type hints, parameter names, doctest examples, and the test harness in MBPP ``assert`` blocks are preserved verbatim — a genuine solver still passes the gold tests. Cross-validator agreement: same ``(prompt, block_seed)`` → identical paraphrased prompt because the per-prompt seed is mixed via ``_stable_seed_from_text``. Mixing v22 and v23 records would let a HumanEval/MBPP wording-memoriser keep their stale code_bench=1.0 floor while honest miners regrade against rotated phrasings — the king filter requires v23+ to claim the crown so the gamed records are quarantined until regraded. Session 3.15 — math_bench / tool_use_bench / self_consistency_bench problem paraphrase per round. The round-21 paraphrase defence covered ``aime_bench`` (~90 public items) but left the much larger math-bench surface (1 319 GSM8K + 500 MATH-500 = 1 819 public items) wide open. ``math_bench`` is also the heaviest single bench weight at 0.12 (vs ``robustness_bench`` at 0.04), so a miner who memorised canonical wording could saturate it for a +0.12 weight payoff and only lose 0.04 on robustness — net +0.08 weight gain even after the round-21 audit. v22 applies the same math-domain-safe paraphrase helpers (``_apply_instruction_synonyms`` + ``_imperative_to_question``) to math_bench, tool_use_bench, and self_consistency_bench items at round-start, keyed on ``(block_seed, sha(question))``. All three axes pull from the GSM8K / MATH-500 pool, so they share the same canonical-wording attack surface — closing all three together stops the +0.20 cumulative weight payoff the previous gap allowed. Numeric constants, LaTeX (``$...$``, ``\\boxed{...}``), GSM8K ``####`` answer markers, and the ``\\n\\n`` format suffix are preserved verbatim by the helpers, so a model that genuinely understands the problem still scores; only ``{problem_text → answer}`` lookups break. Mixing v21 and v22 records would let a wording memoriser keep their math_bench=0.9 floor under the old grading while honest miners regrade against rotated phrasings — re-grounding via the king filter is required. Session 3.14 — AIME problem paraphrase per round. Pre-v21 ``aime_bench`` used the canonical AIME problem wording verbatim. The pool is ~90 public items from ``HuggingFaceH4/aime_2025`` + ``Maxwell-Jia/AIME_2024`` + ``AI-MO/aimo-validation-aime`` with integer answers 0–999. A miner who pre-trains on the public datasets can build a ``{problem_text → answer}`` lookup keyed on canonical wording. AIME isn't currently the dominant Goodhart vector (round-18 logs show top score 0.25 = 2/6, suggesting partial memorization but not full saturation) but the attack scales linearly with how much of the public pool a miner caches. v21+ wraps each AIME problem with the same math-domain-safe paraphrase helpers used by robustness_bench (``_apply_instruction_synonyms`` + ``_imperative_to_question``) keyed on ``(block_seed, sha(question))``. The synonym table only touches instruction verbs (``find``/``calculate``/``determine``) and the imperative→question rewrite only edits the closing sentence — digits, LaTeX, and boxed format are preserved so the math is unchanged. A genuine reasoner solves it; a memoriser keyed on canonical wording fails. Session 3.13 — per-round MC option shuffle for arc_bench / knowledge_bench / truthful_bench. Pre-v20 the ARC and MMLU-Pro pools shipped with a fixed correct-letter per question (the original dataset order), and ``truthful_bench`` shuffled per-question only at load time. A miner who pre-trained on the public ``allenai/ai2_arc`` and ``TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro`` datasets could build a ``{question_text → correct_letter}`` lookup and saturate ``arc_bench`` without parsing the options. Round 18 logs caught this in the wild: 8 distinct miners scored ``arc_bench=1.000`` while their ``knowledge_bench`` was 0.0–0.25 (uids 11/22/40/42/61/64/69/79). Rotating the option order per ``(block_seed, sha256(question))`` forces the correct letter to change every round so a memorised lookup is wrong on every refresh; the model has to actually parse the option text. Cross-validator agreement preserved (every validator with the same block_seed produces the same shuffle). Session 3.12 — capability_probe procedural rebalance. Pre-v19 the capability axis (composite weight 0.25, the second-highest after on_policy_rkl) drew 24 of its 36 items per round from a static trivia pool baked into the open-source pod_eval_vllm.py. The pool rotates 24/200 items per round but the pool is public, so a miner can pre-train answers to every entry and saturate this axis. Round 18 evidence (composite_scores.json) confirmed the attack: ``ty4321/cc`` scored capability=1.000 perfect while bombing math_bench=0.500, code_bench=0.500, aime_bench=0.000, knowledge_bench=0.500 — a textbook overfit-one-axis Goodhart signature. Several other ty4321 commitments showed the same pattern: capability ≥ 0.95 with reasoning_bench / knowledge_bench < 0.30. v19+ flips the static/procedural ratio (CAPABILITY_PROBE_N=12 down from 24, CAPABILITY_PROBE_N_PROC_MATH=24 up from 12) and broadens the procedural generator (``_procedural_capability_prompts``) beyond arithmetic to number theory, string ops (count chars / vowels), list ops (min/max/count), and comparison. All procedural items are block_seed-derived so the (operands, items) tuple is fresh every round and cannot be memorized; total per-round count stays at 36 so wall-clock cost is unchanged. Mixing v18 and v19 records would let an old static-pool memorizer keep their capability=1.0 floor while honest miners regrade against the harder mix — ranking re-grounded by the king filter. Session 3.11 — MBPP+HumanEval prose-stripping. Pre-v18 the sandbox accepted the model generation almost-verbatim: ``_strip_code_fences`` peeled markdown fences and an auto-indent path repaired bare unindented bodies, but a chatty model that wrapped a CORRECT solution in conversational prose ("Sure, here's the function:" / "Hope this helps!") tripped a SyntaxError instead of being graded on its code. Confirmed via synthetic repro on ``def is_sorted(...)`` and seen in real eval logs as IndentationError on Qwen-class HumanEval/13 outputs. That penalises coding ability on the basis of pedantic instruction-following — already measured separately in ``ifeval_bench`` — so it is a textbook Goodhart vector. v18+ adds ``_find_parseable_gen_window`` which uses ``ast.parse`` to find the largest contiguous gen line range that, concatenated to the prompt, parses cleanly. Conservative: never invents code, never re-orders lines, and the empty-prompt MBPP variant additionally requires the entry-point ``def`` to survive the trim. Mixing v17 and v18 records would let a model whose chatty wrapping was previously masked recover the earned-but-blocked passes — composite scores need to be re-grounded on a uniform sandbox. The ``_strip_code_fences`` helper was also hardened to handle paired fences with both leading and trailing prose (regex over the whole string) and to disambiguate the single-marker fallback by preferring the side that precedes the bare ``\`\`\``` marker. Session 3.10 — on_policy_rkl per-round seed rotation. Pre-v17 the student rollout-sampling seed was the constant ``ON_POLICY_RKL_SEED=42`` for every round. Combined with the prompt-pool rotation, that meant ``torch.manual_seed(42 + p_idx)`` was the SAME across rounds for every prompt position — a miner who knew the public 80-prompt pool could pre-compute their model's exact rollout (deterministic given weights + sampling seed + prompt) and surgically train weights to place teacher-high-prob tokens onto that exact sampled trajectory. That's a direct attack on the highest-weight axis (on_policy_rkl is composite-weighted higher than every benchmark axis). v17+ derives the sampling seed from ``XOR(ON_POLICY_RKL_SEED, block_seed) & 0xFFFFFFFF`` so the trajectory rotates per round (every validator agrees but per-round-rollout overfitting is impractical, requiring intra-round retraining). Mixing v16 and v17 records would let a per-round-overfitter inherit the crown via inflated on_policy_rkl. v16 robustness paraphrase, v15 prompt-injection defense, and v14 code_bench auto-indent fix carry forward unchanged.

# ── Per-axis baseline-relative penalty (2026-04-28, v29.1) ────────────
# The 2026-04-28 audit confirmed every king from 2026-04-17 → today
# regressed below Qwen3.5-4B base on the held-out canary (-7.4pp gsm8k,
# -10pp ifeval, -16pp bbh, -12pp humaneval typical). The pre-existing
# defenses — ``_baseline_floor_dethrone_veto`` (10pp absolute floor) and
# ``king_canary_streak`` (2-round held-out streak) — both fire AT
# crowning / streak time, not during scoring. So a model can climb
# composite.worst and stay there indefinitely while regressing on real
# capability versus the un-distilled control.
#
# The fix is to make the per-axis composite directly reflect "stay
# above Qwen-4B-base". For each enabled bench axis, we compare each
# student's pass_frac to the *same-round* reference (REFERENCE_UID = -1,
# Qwen3.5-4B) score on the SAME block-seeded items. If the student is
# below the reference, the axis value gets docked by
# ``alpha * (ref - student)`` clipped to 0, where ``alpha`` is the
# regression weight.
#
# Why this works:
#   * Same-round paired comparison: both models see identical procedural
#     items (block_seed-deterministic), so the comparison is sample-
#     paired and free of cross-round prompt drift.
#   * Reward parity, punish regression: a student that BEATS base on
#     math gets full credit. A student that ties gets full credit. A
#     student that regresses is docked proportionally.
#   * No artificial ceiling: students who legitimately exceed base on
#     an axis are unaffected — overfitting in the *good* direction
#     (genuine skill > base) is encouraged.
#   * Compatible with worst-axis aggregation: the docked axis flows
#     into worst() so the dethrone gate naturally favors balanced-and-
#     above-base students over below-base specialists.
#
# Calibration:
#   * ``BASELINE_RELATIVE_PENALTY_ALPHA = 1.5`` — a 10pp regression below
#     base docks the axis by 15pp. This makes "stay at parity" the
#     dominant strategy: it costs the same as a 6.7pp axis-specific
#     improvement to drop 10pp on another axis. Aligned with the pre-
#     existing ``BASELINE_FLOOR_MARGIN = 0.10`` veto threshold.
#   * Penalty applied to bench axes only. Relative axes (kl, on_policy_rkl,
#     capability, length, degeneracy) are normalized differently and
#     would double-penalize. The judge_probe / chat_turns_probe axes
#     are absolute correctness but reference-model-flat (small dynamic
#     range), so we exclude them too.

# ── Teacher sanity gate (2026-04-23) ──────────────────────────────────────
# For each ranking axis we can optionally compute the axis value for the

# it can corrupt rankings. This is the structural defense against the
# 2026-04-19 outage class (Wilson-anchor think-probe DQ'd the teacher
# itself, so every student failed). See
# ``reports/2026-04-23-goodhart-immune-eval.md`` section on invariants.
#
# Threshold reasoning: a well-calibrated axis should show the teacher at
# >= 0.85 comfortably (the teacher IS what we distill to, any axis where
# the teacher scores poorly is definitionally measuring the wrong thing).
# We pick 0.70 as the "drop the axis" floor to give some slack for
# stochasticity in the teacher's own generations (temperature=0 helps but
# vLLM sampling can still jitter), while still catching outright bugs.

# measuring an eval-setup bug (token truncation, malformed prompt,
# unsolvable item set, etc.). Audit 2026-04-26 of last_eval.json showed
# the reference scoring 0 on aime_bench (token truncation), code_bench,
# tool_use_bench, and noise_resistance_bench — locking ``worst() == 0``
# for all 36 current-schema records and making the dethrone gate
# degenerate. By dropping such axes from ``worst()`` we restore signal
# without giving miners a free pass: the axes still appear in the
# ``axes`` dict and contribute to ``weighted`` aggregation.

    We emit *both* aggregations so the validator can A/B them offline
    before committing to one as the canonical score:

    - ``worst`` (Coste 2024, Pan 2025 min-form): the minimum of present
      axes. This is the anti-gaming rule — you win only if all axes are
      competitive. Robust to axis-specific overfitting.
    - ``weighted`` (standard convex combination with AXIS_WEIGHTS): a
      softer aggregation that still rewards high-KL students somewhat,
      useful during the grace period so we don't suddenly dethrone the
      current king while miners re-tool.

    ``broken_axes`` (2026-04-23 / refined 2026-04-26): axes that should
    not gate the dethrone decision. Two distinct sources:
      * teacher-broken — the teacher itself failed the sanity floor this
        round (``resolve_teacher_broken_axes``).
      * reference-broken — the reference base model scored 0 on the axis
        (``resolve_reference_broken_axes``). This indicates an
        eval-setup signal (token truncation, parsing bug, unsolvable
        items), not student skill.

    Filter semantics (refined 2026-04-26):
      * ``worst`` excludes broken axes — otherwise the worst-axis
        anti-gaming rule degenerates to ``min == 0`` for every student
        whenever an axis hits a setup floor.
      * ``weighted`` KEEPS broken axes when computable — a student who
        scores >0 on a broken axis (e.g. they actually solved
        tool_use_bench while Qwen base couldn't) still gets credit in
        the soft aggregator. Only axes a student didn't even score
        (None) drop out of weighted.

    reference-broken sets via ``broken_axes``.

      ``state/benchmarks/<KING_CANARY_BASELINE_FILE>`` — Qwen 4B base
                                                    reference (default

    Computes the king's mean held-out score across ``KING_CANARY_AXES``
    (only axes with positive ``count`` count toward the mean) and the
    baseline's mean over the same axes, then flags at_risk when the
    king is more than ``KING_CANARY_MARGIN`` (default 5 pp) below the
    baseline. Used by ``state_manager.py`` to maintain a separate
    ``king_canary_streak`` and by ``_king_regression_floor_waived`` to
    waive the composite-floor veto for canary-regressing kings.

    Returns None if either file is missing, the uid in the king file
    doesn't match, or there are no comparable axes (fail open — never
    block dethrones on noisy probe data).
