"""Multi-axis composite score computation — production ranking + dethrone gate.

Core idea: a single scalar like KL can be over-optimized until the model is
useless under autoregressive sampling (the Tiapkin 2025 "Teacher Hacking"
pathology, empirically visible on the 2026-04-22 SN97 king, which rambles
3–10x longer than the teacher on trivial prompts while passing KL). The
fix is to score each student on several independent axes and combine them
with a worst-case rule, so that gaming any single axis penalizes overall
rank.

This module is intentionally pure-Python, no ML deps, safe to import from
the validator service. It consumes the JSON that ``pod_eval_vllm.py``
writes per student and emits a ``composite`` score and per-axis breakdown.

Status: PRODUCTION — ranking + dethrone veto.
  * 2026-04-19 (commit 8eec9a2): promoted from shadow to production
    ranking key. ``composite.worst`` orders the leaderboard and selects
    the canonical challenger for display.
  * 2026-04-22: ``composite.worst`` is now ALSO a dethrone gate. A
    challenger that passes the KL paired t-test + 3% epsilon is still
    blocked from taking the crown if its worst composite axis is below
    ``COMPOSITE_DETHRONE_FLOOR`` (currently 0.20). See
    ``scripts/validator/results.py::_composite_dethrone_veto``.
  * Same commit: the ``length`` axis is now always populated even when
    ``THINK_COLLAPSE_PROBE=0``. It falls back to the always-on
    ``chat_probe`` length vs a teacher anchor captured in
    ``prepare_teacher_probe_refs_*``. This closes the gap that let a
    KL-specialized-but-rambling model keep the crown unopposed.
  * 2026-04-23: judge-probe axis added in SHADOW mode. The teacher
    scores each student's greedy response to 16 rotated realistic
    prompts on a 1-5 rubric, normalized to [0, 1]. Computed + logged
    per round but excluded from ``worst`` / ``weighted`` aggregation
    until the ``JUDGE_AXIS_IN_COMPOSITE`` gate flips (Session 2). See
    ``reports/2026-04-23-goodhart-immune-eval.md``.
  * 2026-04-24: **Arena v3 — comprehensive eval**. Session 2 promoted:
    the five absolute-correctness bench axes (``math_bench``,
    ``code_bench``, ``reasoning_bench``, ``knowledge_bench``,
    ``ifeval_bench``) and ``judge_probe`` are now all IN the composite
    ranking by default. These break the last Goodhart hole — the old
    six axes all scored *relative* to the teacher, so a perfectly-
    distilled model of a non-SOTA teacher ranked #1 but couldn't do
    grade-school math. New axes score against ground truth so
    overfitting them ⇒ SOTA small model.
  * 2026-04-24: **Session 3 axes promoted live**:
    ``aime_bench`` (AIME olympiad math), ``mbpp_bench`` (MBPP+ code),
    ``tool_use_bench`` (agentic Python tool use), and
    ``self_consistency_bench`` (majority-vote over sampled generations).
    These give miners more surface area to optimize against, each
    pointing towards a genuinely valuable capability. See
    ``reports/2026-04-24-arena-v3.md`` for the full Affine-Cortex-
    inspired design.
  * 2026-04-24: **Pareto majority dominance**: in addition
    to the worst-axis floor, a challenger that beats the king on KL
    but loses on a majority of axes is blocked. This is part of the
    dethrone gate by default after the public telemetry window.
  * 2026-04-25: Session 3.1 ``arc_bench`` (AI2 ARC-Challenge
    commonsense science MC), 3.2 ``reasoning_density`` (pass_frac ×
    length_bonus — explicitly penalizes over-think-on-trivia),
    3.3 ``chat_turns_probe`` (teacher-graded 3-turn dialogues),
    3.4 ``truthful_bench`` (TruthfulQA adversarial factuality),
    3.5 ``long_context_bench`` (procedural needle-in-haystack
    over ~1400 tokens — literally uncheatable because items are
    generated fresh every round from the block_seed, no fixed
    dataset exists), and 3.6 ``procedural_bench`` (block-seeded
    synthetic reasoning / instruction following / factual retrieval).
    Each targets a capability that Session 2 + relative axes don't
    already reward, so climbing them requires genuine model improvement. See
    ``reports/2026-04-24-arena-v3.md`` and the ``MINER_FAQ.md``
    playbook.

Axes that are missing for a given round (e.g. ``degeneracy`` while
``THINK_COLLAPSE_PROBE=0``) drop out and the weighted mean renormalizes
over the surviving axes. The veto fails open if fewer than
``COMPOSITE_DETHRONE_MIN_AXES`` axes are populated — we don't want a pod
probe outage to freeze the crown.

    For each bench axis the student actually ran, compute

    soft penalty around the per-bench target token count:

        ratio   = mean_gen_tokens_correct / target

    So at ratio=1 we get 1.0, at ratio=2 we get 0.5, at ratio=4 we get
    0.25. No bonus below ratio=1 so a concise correct model gets the
    same credit as one that matches target exactly; this rewards
    efficiency without penalizing further.

    The axis value is the mean of per-bench efficiencies over whichever
