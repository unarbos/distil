"""One-shot cleanup for the activation-copy DQ bug (Apr 18).

What this fixes:
  1. Backfills `commit_block` into `activation_fingerprints.json` entries that
     were stored before the field was added. Uses `model_hashes.json` (which
     records `{uid}_block`) as the source of truth.
  2. Clears activation-copy DQs where the DQ'd UID actually committed EARLIER
     than the claimed "original". These DQs came from the broken fast-path in
     precheck.py that passed commit_block=None to `check_activation_fingerprint`,
     which then defaulted to infinity and always marked the incoming UID as later.

Run once, then restart the validator.

Idempotent: safe to run twice. Makes a .bak file before any write.
